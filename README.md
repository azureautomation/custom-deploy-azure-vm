Custom Deploy Azure VM
======================

            

The script provides you with a Graphical interface to easily redeploy VM from existing vhd’s or managed disk. It also allows you to easily deploy a VM from a customized image which is currently not available in the Azure Portal GUI.


When deploying from a custom image, only managed disk is available. All ResourceGroups , netowrks and subnets must be precreated, before running this script. Availability Sets will only populate for ResourceGroups where they exist.

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
